Inefficient handling of user-reported issues such as login failures and malfunctioning features can significantly disrupt the intended user experience of an application. To address this challenge, a systematic issue tracking and resolution system is essential. Bug Tracking System aims to develop and implement such a system to ensure a seamless user journey. The proposed system involves categorizing bug types based on the bugs severity(priority) based on predefined criteria, fostering communication and collaboration within the development team.
